by Jiahui Lu (jl3947), Wenjia Zhai (wz363), Yishan Xiong (yx468)

### Introduction
The stock trading is exciting for its uncertainty, however, for the future practitioner in financial industry, we believe that
there are certain rules lying in the numbers. Traditionally, people use linear multifactorial model to predict future stock price
to reduce the possible risks and maximize the profit.
In this project, we are going to use several machine learning models to predict the direction of the stock price, in other
words, it is a classification problem with 2 categories: up and down. We plan to utilize efficient models such as neutral network,random tree, decision tree and SVM to achieve our goal.

### Our data set:
“Intra-day data of S&P500 stocks” from Wharton



### Our steps: 

1. Feature engineering: Ordinal data: stock fundamental information data, Numeric data: stock price data, stock’s company financial data
2. Modeling: decision tree, random forest, support vector machine algorithm and XGboost
3. Comparing: Using backtest results from the models above, compare the accuracy and complexity of algorithms 
4. Limitation and possible solutions

### Expected outcome:
Finding a machine learning model which could predict the rise and fall of stock price  with relatively high accuracy.
